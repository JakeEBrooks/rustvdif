# Rust VDIF
A rust crate for interacting with data encoded in the VLBI Data Interchange Format (VDIF), commonly used in radio astronomy experiments. The VDIF data format is defined in the VDIF specification, found [here](https://vlbi.org/vlbi-standards/vdif/).

This is a minimalist crate designed to relieve the problem of dealing with VDIF data in your own applications.
